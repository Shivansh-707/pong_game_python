This project is a simple recreation of the classic Pong game, built using the Pygame library in Python.
It features a player paddle, an AI-controlled opponent paddle, and a bouncing ball. 
The player controls their paddle using the up and down arrow keys, aiming to bounce the ball past the opponent.

The game includes basic physics like ball collisions with paddles and screen edges, a simple AI that tracks the ballâ€™s movement,
and clean visual elements like a center line and smooth animation. 
It's a fun way to explore game development fundamentals such as object movement, collision detection, and game loops using Python.
